title: "When-will-Lazarus-rise?"
date: 2023-12-19

no fucking clue how this works(yet). listening to some absolutely beautiful music, which you should listen to when high. the other side of paradise by glass animals is peak.

why did i create this? well, if it isnt obvious yet, i couldnt care less about my beloved readers(or good punctuation for that matter). this will mostly be a platform for me to speak to myself about whatever i am thinking about. i used to have a desire to journal aggressively, but i cannot put pen to paper that often and easily apparently. hopefully, my addiction to my beautiful laptop, which i have spent the last hour or so customizing a little, will result in me writing here more often than i wrote on paper.

so why do i want to write at all? well, i am apparently deeply depressed, and i want to put a bullet between my eyes nearly every other day. the depression is due to my circumstance right now which is partially my own fault, but mostly just shit luck. boo.freaking.hoo. anyway, i need to get out of this melancholy and i have observed there are two primary problems i face, which will be detailed in due course, my dear reader. 

i do have a deep desire to rise from the dead, where i feel i am right now, much like the titular Lazarus. lazarus of bethany was an ardent follower of jesus. one day, while he is ill, his sisters approach jesus and ask for him to cure their brother. jesus tells his followers that he will show his truth as the son of God and that he will wait. lazarus dies. jesus goes to his village, to find his sisters mourning. however, jesus asks them if they have faith in him, and they reply that they believe in him as the messiah, and the son of God, and he would save them. this blind faith even in the face of the most absolute thing in the world, death, is what stands out to me in this story. however, i digress. jesus weeps, which is the shortest line in the bible. why does he weep? does he weep because of the pain he caused his disciples just to show his powers, and feels guilt? or is it happiness at the blind faith? the faith which has kept them going. the faith which keeps us all going. the faith which keeps me going right now. a year back, on the night of new year's eve, i had written a note to myself, telling myself about how wondrous the following year was going to be, how i was going to ace the absolute fuck out of JEE, get into the college of my dreams, have an amazing and happy first year in college, with tons of friends and a girlfriend, and start working on myself and other things. however, the common connect between everything i had mentioned, my optimism that i would get an absolutely amazing rank in JEE or whatever else, was blind faith and optimism. i never doubted for a second that things would turn out the other way. it was absolute and complete blind faith in myself. i truly believed that after years of hell, i would finally be happy and that things would finally turn my way. however, as we leave 2023 and enter 2024, i no longer have the same faith i did last year. i no longer have the same blind, absolute faith i did last year. i am no longer optimistic about anything. i am scared to even feel hope about the next year. i feel absolutely crushed and at my rock bottom. its been a tough four years and there seems to be no end in sight. i am too tired to even fight the next battle. 

but isnt now the exact right time when you need blind faith? its counter-intuitive, sure, but think about it. lazarus' sisters might or might not have had faith in the best of times, whereas i had blind faith in the best of times, just before JEE. but right now, when things are rock bottom, shouldn't you have blind faith now? when things are good, EVERYONE has faith. but what determines your future, whether you stand to fight another day, whether you push through the sludge, is your blind faith in the worst of times. right now, life is extremely weird. its the best of times and the worst of times. but the one change over the last few weeks, is my optimism. however, this time, it feels like a more enduring optimism. without the blind faith that things will turn out for the better, how will you stand to fight another day? how do you not collapse? if you collapse and you dont stand to fight another day, how will things ever turn out for the better? how will you ever feel better? if you truly want things to turn out for the better, you need blind faith. in god, in yourself, in destiny, in whatever. 

going back to the story of lazarus, jesus asks the onlookers that didnt he say that if they believed, wouldnt they see the glory of god? and he revives lazarus. while i do believe that optimism and pessimism are retarded ideologies, sometimes in life, you need to be absolutely optimistic. there is work which needs to be done. i need to get rich. i need to build the things i have always dreamt of building. when pursuing these goals, optimism and pessimism do not matter. the work is important enough that optimism and pessimism do not matter. even if you pessimistic that the thing will not work out, getting rich is an important enough end goal that the pessimism doesnt matter. will you just roll over and let the thing take over you? let life just pass you by? think about what could have been 30 years down the line? even if you are pessimistic, take the fucking shot. the worst that can happen is you feel like shit for a while if it fails. but this is intense and short term pain. however, if in your pessimism, you never shoot your shot, you will never truly know your limits, you will never become better. if you aim for the stars, you will atleast reach the moon. if you never shoot your shot, the regret and pain that your life could have been something else, something unrecognizable to you today, will forever kill you, slowly. god speaks to us in stories, because writing shit like this is nice, sure, but hard to internalize. so let me narrate a story. if i hadnt broken up with namya the very first time, over the most stupid fucking shit, which was a little less effort from her end, understandably so in hindsight due to JEE, we would still be together and very much in love. if i hadnt been a cunt to her and told her to do something sexual for me just because of my horniness, we would still be together and very much in love. she obviously had good reason to be afraid of something sexual when we hadn't even met, and online. in the weirdest way, we would have fucked by now, if i hadnt said that dumb shit. i deeply regret all the things i said and did to her. i truly did love her, no matter how much i try to convince myself i didnt, and she probably truly loved me at some point too. i lost a beautiful girl, my girl, whom i truly loved, and was probably made for me by god himself. we could have had a beautiful relationship, a very strong and long one, if i hadnt done this absolute dumb shit. we could have fucked by now, done all the things we had dreamt of doing on my birthday. if i hadnt done that dumb shit. and for what? just one nude and a jerk off session? just for one more dumb fucking story on instagram showing off my girl? for one little cute thing, compared to all the shit she was planning on doing for me after her JEE? if you read these, you realise that none of these were worth it. coming back to my original point, regret kills. regret is single-handedly the worst thing you can feel in this world. its worse than anger, envy, ego crushes, any of them. and if you spend your whole life in the same pessimism you are in right now, you will pass up opportunities and openings you never knew existed. fuck that shit. theres work which needs to be done. it will be done. pessimism is dangerous. optimism, or blind faith, will keep you going when the going gets tough. theres some things i have to say on purpose and what we are supposed to take the hits for, what to actually work towards, what is actually important(so important that pessimism and optimism stop mattering, and the only thing which matters, is that the work needs to be done and it needs to keep getting better. pessimism is pointless because the work is so important that even if there is .1% chance that it might be done, you need to fucking do it and take the shot, because the alternative is a world without it, which should be extremely scary if the endgoal of the work is important enough to you, and optimism is pointless, because of your fear of complacence towards the work, because of your sheer passion for your work, where good tidings boost you to work harder and to make the endgoal even better. things seem to be working out well, great, make the end EVEN better and you actually like or love the process and doing the thing, resulting in optimism becoming pointless) and why, but thats for another time. but for now, id like to end this thing ive been writing.

so thats it. its been an absolute schoolyard bully of a year, i have suffered the worst hits of my life, back-to-back in succession. i am at the worst i have ever been. i have no energy left to stand up, and no will to fight another day. i feel completely lonely in this world, and my own parents have forsaken me. i have lost nearly everything i held dear this year. 2023 was easily the worst year of my life so far. but unlike the past, there is one difference this year, as we head into 2024. i am not letting regret take over my life, that will just make shit worse. i am not letting depression, sadness or melancholy take over my life either, and i am going to stop wallowing around in my own sadness like a sad little cunt. i am taking the blind faith-pill. in 2024, i am not asking for certain things, nor am i even thinking that certain things are going to happen or things are going to get better for me in a certain way. im just having blind faith that i will be happy in 2024, due to something which will happen. i dont know what will happen, but something will. something will change my life this year, for the better, and i am not limiting my life by my retarded wishes and single-mindedly pursuing them, letting other opportunities and life pass me by. its a vague sense of optimism. things are going to get better this year. i dont know why i believe this, but i just do. 2024 will be the year. and this year, i dont care if it works out or not. im just going to be happy where i am. i am going to get better and work on myself this year, and do everything i ever wanted to. something is gonna happen this year, and i am not sure what exactly it is, but it will happen. i am going to relax more this year, and stop taking shit so personally. shit fucking happens, boo.freaking.hoo. cry for a day, whine about it, and then, move on. because eternal whining may get you sympathy, pity and a temporary dope hit, but it wont make things better for you, steals opportunities from you and it steals all the bigger dopamine hits you could have gotten.

if 2023 was self-assured confidence in specific things working out, 2024 is just going to be a blind leap of faith, its going to be blind optimism. i am dead right now like lazarus, and in 2024, i have the blind faith, that god or whoever or whatever is going to revive me. its been a hell of a year. 2023 was one absolute fucking roller coaster of a year. if i told Jan 2023 me of what has happened in the last year, he would absolutely not believe a single word of what i say. jee, namya, iitk, delhi, alcohol, its been an absolute insane, peak dad-lore of a year. and thats what im grateful for, even if this year absolutely brought me down to my knees and shattered me. its all the people i met, all the stories i have collected, and the insane fucking journey ive had this year. 2024 will be better. i just know somehow. and i will work towards it. i have fucked around for too long. i have work to do now. i actually need to become sigma trillionaire hustle grindset nigga. gym, business, stocks, cpi, nuclear fusion, socialising, whatever. blind faith in 2024 brother, blind faith in 2024. though its the 19th of December, 2023, 5:45 am right now, Happy New Year, Daksh. 2024 is going to be a great year. conservation of luck, karma, exists. and all the pain i have suffered for these four years, is going to be made right in 2024. all the pain is going to become happiness, and i will get it in 2024. Happy 2024!
